0.0.13 - TBD
  * Add concept of Outputters.
  * Create PDF and HTML outputters.
  * Create PaperClaim outputter for HIPAA_837::L2000A.
  * Refactor parsing so any descendant of TransactionSet::Base is
    able to parse a string representation of itself.
  * Refactor Separator module to use super instead of a custom
    function call to initialize the separators.
  * Fix project so that we do not modify $LOAD_PATH.
  * Only use autoload for Segments and TransactionSets that are optional.
0.0.12 - 2011/12/22
  * Fix a number of parsing errors.
    * Ensure that we only evaluate the first segment when matching
      against non-loop components.
    * Fix issue causing sub-loops to be reversed on parsing.
    * Fix issue preventing proper recursion when parsing a repeating
      component inside TransactionSet::Base.
0.0.11 - 2011/12/18
  * Ignore Base Control Set when parsing input files.
  * Make sure to only append a segment when we are within a transaction.
  * Added TA1 segment.
  * Add ISA, GS, GE, and IEA to TransactionSets::Base, and populate them
    when parsing.  This allows the client application to access each
    transaction sets individual envelope.
  * Added common code lists including:
    - Claim Adjustment Reason Codes
    - Claim Status Category Codes
    - Claim Status Codes
    - Remittance Advice Remark Codes
    - Service Type Codes
    - Taxonomy Codes
  * Fix issue preventing repeating loops from being parsed properly.
  * Allow accessing composite fields via shorthand notation. (e.g
    SV101_01 = SV1.ProductServiceIdQualifier)
0.0.10 - 2011/11/29
  * Fix autoload issue with enveloping structures.
0.0.9 - 2011/11/29
  * Update Enveloping structures for 5010.
0.0.8 - 2011/11/15
  * Add ability to use Regexp with TransactionSet::Base#find_by_name.
0.0.7 - 2011/11/15
  * Add TransactionSet::Base#find_by_name to allow searching for components
    by name rather than only by identifier.
0.0.6 - 2011/11/09
  * Add Separator module for handling segment, field, composite, and
    repetition separators the same.
  * Respect 'parent's separators when building/initializing components.
  * Fixed parsing logic to properly handle nested groups.
0.0.5 - 2011/09/16
  * Add ability to parse transaction sets.
0.0.4
  * Fix issue when no values are set in any subfield of a composite field.
  * Add more segment tests.
  * Import all segments and loops from the X12 CSV Table Data
  * Initial version.
